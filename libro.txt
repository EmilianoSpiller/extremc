Whenever you run an executable file, the operating system creates new process.
A process is a live and running program that is loaded into the memory 
and has a unique identifier (PID).
The operating system is the sole responsible entity for spawnig  and 
loading a new process.
A process remains running until it either exists normally, or the process 
is given a signal(such as SIGTERM). The SIGTERM and SIGINT signals cna be ignored, but SIGKILL
will kill the process immediately and forcefully.
When creating a process, one of the first things that operating system do is to allocate a portion 
of memory dedicated to the process and then apply a predefind memory layout.
This predefined memory layout is more or less the same in different operating systems, especially in Unix-like os.

The memory layout of an ordinary process is divided into multiple parts.
