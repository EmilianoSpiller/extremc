Whenever you run an executable file, the operating system creates new process.
A process is a live and running program that is loaded into the memory 
and has a unique identifier (PID).
The operating system is the sole responsible entity for spawnig  and 
loading a new process.
A process remains running until it either exists normally, or the process 
is given a signal.
